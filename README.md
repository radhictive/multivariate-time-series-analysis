# Multivariate Time Series Analysis on Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset

In this project the target is to predict Traffic Volume. But for me main goal is exploring and analyzing multivariate time series, implementing feature engineering techniques to multivariate time series and creating prediction models. LightGBM, SVM, KNN, Prophet Multivariate(Facebook), LSTM and VAR(Vector Auto Regression) models used in this project.
The dataset used here is : https://www.kaggle.com/ramyahr/metro-interstate-traffic-volume/data
